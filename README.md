# üç∑ Red Wine Quality Predictor

A machine learning web application built with Streamlit that predicts red wine quality based on chemical properties.

## Features

- Interactive web interface with intuitive sliders
- Real-time wine quality prediction
- Confidence score display
- Professional UI with emojis and clear visual feedback

## Wine Attributes Used

The model uses the following 11 chemical properties to predict wine quality:

**Acidity & Sugar:**
- Fixed Acidity
- Volatile Acidity
- Citric Acid
- Residual Sugar

**Salt & Sulfur:**
- Chlorides
- Free Sulfur Dioxide
- Total Sulfur Dioxide

**Other Properties:**
- Density
- pH
- Sulphates
- Alcohol

## How to Use

1. Adjust the sliders in the sidebar to input wine attributes
2. Click "üöÄ Predict Quality" button
3. View the prediction result and confidence score
